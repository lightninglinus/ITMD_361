  <h1>Josh Linus Sumed up in 3 Sentences</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Joshua Linus, and I am currently a sophomore studying ITM and hoping to specialize in cyber security. I live on the north side of the city in a neighborhood called Avondale. I am orginally from Mumbai, India but have been living here for almost a decade. I love running, biking, exploring new places, and pretty much anything pyhsical.  </p>
